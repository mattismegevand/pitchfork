## Usage

This dataset is publicly available for research. The data is provided 'as is', and you assume full responsibility for any legal or ethical issues that may arise from the use of the data.

## Scraping Process

The dataset was generated by scraping the Pitchfork website. The Python script uses the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries to send HTTP requests to the website and parse the resulting HTML content.

The script saves the data in an SQLite database and can also export the data to a CSV file. Duplicate entries are avoided by checking for existing entries with the same artist and album name before inserting new ones into the database.

## Potential Applications

This dataset can be used for a variety of research purposes, such as:

- Music information retrieval
- Text mining and sentiment analysis
- Music recommendation systems
- Music trend analysis

## Acknowledgments
